# Tic-Tac-Toe-2023
Redo the Tic Tac Toe project

A complete rewriting of the Tic Tac Toe with a better understanding of 
- Object Oriented Programming
- the MCV model
- minimax algorithm
- webpack
- and a bit of async programming (Promise)

Although the UI looks the same as m last version, it still took me a whole week to complete.

Supports:
- human vs. human
- human vs. random computer
- human vs. computer AI (minimax)
- play configurable number of games
